# Group assignment 1.6 - Icy Dicey Propagation

*Due: 12:30 on Friday, October 10th, 2025.*

GA 1.6 concerns the propagation of uncertainty, in particular focusing on the first two moments: Mean and Variance. This is done via an analytical approach, i.e. Taylor approximation that allows propagating moments of the distribution, and later with a numerical approach, i.e. mean-variance sample estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. 

Ultimately, the two strategies are compared in the Python Jupiter Notebook, and discussed by the students in a short report.

### Evaluation remark
Make sure to finalize the Report (more important!), and that files are in the root directory of this repository (i.e., same as this README file).
