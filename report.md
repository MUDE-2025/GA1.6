*Most of the questions require you to finish `Analysis.ipynb` first, but depending on how you allocate tasks between group members, it is possible to work on this in parallel. Make sure you save time for peer reviewing each others work before completing the assignment!*


**Question 1**

*What is the expected value and standard deviation of the ice thickness after 3 days ($\mu_H$ and $\sigma_H$)? There should be two sets of results.*


**Question 2**

*Explain whether we should use the expected value for our prediction, or whether we should also account for the variability of the thickness estimate in the subsequent phases of our analysis?*


**Question 3**

*How do we obtain the "true" distribution of $H_{ice}$, and what does it look like?*


**Question 4**

*Are the propagated and simulated $\mu_H$ and $\sigma_H$ equivalent?*


**Question 5**

*Is the Normal distribution a reasonable model for $H_{ice}$?*


**Question 6**

*Using the loop in Task 3.1, explore the effect of sample size on the results. Describe the observations you make and explain why they are happening.*


**Question 7**

*Why is the sampling distribution not the "true" distribution?*


**Question 8**

*Describe the values of the function of random variables (the output) for which we might expect the model to be inaccurate. Quantify this inaccuracy by comparing the probability calculated with the assumed distribution with the frequency of similar values observed. Use the empty cell in Task 3 in the `Analysis.ipynb` file for computations.*

*Hint: you can count the number of values in an array that conform to a specific boolean condition using* `sum(MY_ARRAY <= MY_VALUE)`. *It may also be useful to find the length of an array with* `len(MY_ARRAY)`.
